        <h2>What is Parallax</h2>
        <p>Parallax is a displacement or difference in the apparent position of an object viewed along two different
            lines of sight, and is measured by the angle or semi-angle of inclination between those two lines.
        </p>
    </div>

        <p>A simple everyday example of parallax can be seen in the dashboards of motor vehicles that use a needle-style
            non-LCD speedometer gauge. When viewed from directly in front the speed may show exactly 60, but when viewed
            from the passenger seat the needle may appear to show a slightly different speed due to the angle of viewing
            combined with displacement of the needle from the plane of the numerical dial.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>In a philosophic/geometric sense: an apparent change in the direction of an object, caused by a change in
            observational position that provides a new line of sight. The apparent displacement, or difference of
            position, of an object, as seen from two different stations, or points of view.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>The Parallax scrolling technique involves designing the background of a website layout to move at a slower
            rate than the foreground when the user scrolls, creating a 3D-like effect. </p>
